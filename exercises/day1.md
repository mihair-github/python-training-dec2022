### Numeric types exercises

1. Given an integer number, print its last digit. 
1. Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits.
1. Given the integer `N` - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight -
 how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock? 
 The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) 
 and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59). 
 For example, if `N = 150`, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - 
 i.e. now it's 2:30 am. So the program should print **2 30**.

### String exercises

1. Given the string `s = "bandana"`:
    * check if string `"and"` is contained in `s`
    * find the index of the following strings: `"n"`, `"q"`
    * how many times does the string `"an"` appear in `s`?
    * check if `s` is alphanumeric
    * transform `s` to all uppercase
    * check other methods that string supports and try them out

1. Given the string `"abcdefghijklmn"` print the following:
    * the third character of this string.
    * the second to last character of this string.
    * the first five characters of this string.
    * all but the last two characters of this string.
    * all the characters of this string with even indices (remember indexing 
    starts at 0, so the characters are displayed starting with the first).
    * all the characters of this string with odd indices 
    (i.e. starting with the second character in the string).
    * all the characters of the string in reverse order.
    * every second character of the string in reverse order, starting from the 
    last one.
